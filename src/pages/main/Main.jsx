                    <p>I'm Sabine Randow, a 4th year student at Chalmers currently enrolled in the master program High Performance Computer Systems (MPHPC for short). 
                        I moved to Gothenburg the day after my High School graduation 2018, and have been glued to my computer ever since. 
                        In my spare time I'm addicted to keyboards, flowers and making pies.</p>
